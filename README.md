When the user chooses to view all departments, then they are presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids.

When the user chooses to view all employees, then they are presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to. When the user chooses to add a department, then they are prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database.
